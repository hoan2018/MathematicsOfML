        "\n",
        "1. **Data Generation**  \n",
        "   - In a real-world scenario, you would **collect actual wait time data** instead of generating it. Here, we simulate it with a normal distribution centered at 5.5 minutes, implying the true average is slightly above the coffee shop’s claim of 5 minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Formulating Hypotheses**  \n",
        "   - We want to see if the coffee shop’s stated average (5 minutes) is accurate.  \n",
        "   - \\($H_0$): \\($mu = 5$) (the mean wait time is exactly 5 minutes)  \n",
        "   - \\($H_1$): \\($mu \\neq 5$) (the mean wait time is different from 5 minutes)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Performing a One-Sample T-Test**  \n",
        "   - We use `scipy.stats.ttest_1samp(data, mu_0)` to compare our sample's mean to the hypothesized mean (5 minutes).  \n",
        "   - This returns two values:\n",
        "     - `t_statistic`: measures how far the sample mean is from the hypothesized mean in units of standard error.  \n",
        "     - `p_value`: the probability of observing a result at least as extreme as ours, assuming \\($H_0$) is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Constructing a 95% Confidence Interval (CI)**  \n",
        "   - We manually compute the 95% CI for the sample mean:\n",
        "     - \\$\\text{Sample Mean} \\pm t_{\\text{crit}} \\times \\text{Standard Error}$ .  \n",
        "     - If the hypothesized mean (5) is **outside** this interval, it suggests a significant difference at the 5% level.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Interpreting the Results**  \n",
        "   - **p-value**: If \\(p < 0.05\\), we **reject** \\$(H_0\\ $). Otherwise, we **fail to reject** \\$(H_0\\$).  \n",
        "   - **Confidence Interval**: If 5 is not inside the computed interval, we can infer the population mean is likely different from 5 (with 95% confidence).\n"
